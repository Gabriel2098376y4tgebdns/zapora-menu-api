# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

Zapora API implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data and ensure system integrity. This document outlines our security practices and vulnerability reporting process.

## 🔒 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Authentication** with HS256 algorithm
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - User, Manager, Admin roles
- **Token expiration** with configurable timeouts
- **Bcrypt password hashing** with 12 rounds

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS enforced** with automatic SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- **Security headers** - HSTS, CSP, XSS Protection, X-Frame-Options
- **Rate limiting** - 100 requests/minute global, specific limits per endpoint
- **WAF protection** via Nginx Ingress Controller

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest** - AES-256 for database storage
- **Encryption in transit** - TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Secrets management** - Kubernetes secrets with base64 encoding
- **Audit logging** - Complete activity tracking for compliance

### Container Security
- **Non-root user** execution in containers
- **Minimal attack surface** - Alpine-based images
- **Security scanning** - Trivy and Snyk integration
- **Read-only filesystem** where possible

## 🔍 Security Compliance

4. **Disclosure** - Coordinated public disclosure after fix

### 🎯 Vulnerability Severity

| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | 24 hours | Remote code execution, data breach |
| **High** | 72 hours | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | 1 week | Information disclosure, DoS |
| **Low** | 2 weeks | Minor information leaks |

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement input validation on all endpoints
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use static analysis tools

### For Deployments
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates
- Network segmentation
- Backup encryption

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Keep API keys secure
- Report suspicious activity
